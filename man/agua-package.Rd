\title{tidymodels integration with h2o}
\description{
agua has tools that allows users to fit and tune models using the h2o
platform. Most functions in this package are not user facing; agua enables
new parsnip model engines and sets up additional infrastructure for tune.
}
\details{
The package uses code initially written by Steven Pawley in his h2oparsnip
package. Addition work was done by Qiushi Yan as an RStudio summer intern.
