#' tidymodels integration with h2o
#'
#' agua has tools that allows users to fit and tune models using the h2o
#' platform. Most functions in this package are not user facing; agua enables
#' new parsnip model engines and sets up additional infrastructure for tune.
#'
#' The package uses code initially written by Steven Pawley in his h2oparsnip
#' package. Addition work was done by Qiushi Yan as an RStudio summer intern.
